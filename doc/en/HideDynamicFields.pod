=head1 HideDynamicFields

This modules helps you to show/hide dynamic fields in "new ticket" and other dialogs.
When an agents changes the selection of a dropdown field, it is checked whether a dynamic field should
be shown or hidden.

The standard installation of this addon adds a system configuration option that binds the dynamic field
display to the chosen queue.

=head2 Hiding dynamic fields based on the selected queue

This is the standard feature of this addon. In several dialogs the dynamic fields can be hidden. First
you have to define, which dialogs are affected:

In the system configuration setting I<Frontend::Output::FilterContent###HideDynamicFields> you define
in the Templates listing which actions should be handled. By default only AgentTicketEmail and
AgentTicketPhone are handled. You can define any dialog where dynamic fields can be shown (e.g. AgentTicketCompose,
AgentTicketNote, ...).

The next step is define, which dynamic fields should be hidden for certain queues. If you want
to hide the field "OnboardTime" for the queue "IT", you have to define the key "IT" with the
value "OnboardTime" in the system configuration setting I<HideDynamicFields::Filter###Dest>.

If the field "SupportContract" when the agent selects the queue "Human Resources" or the ticket
is in that queue, you have to define the key "Human Resources" with the value "SupportContract" in
the above mentioned setting.

You can hide several fields, just provide a comma separated list of field names in the value part.

=head2 Defining your own bindings

But you can define your own bindings:

Create a custom sysconfig definition file. In this example an OTRS >= 6.0.x version is shown:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <otrs_config version="2.0" init="Config">
        <Setting Name="HideDynamicFields::Filter###PriorityID" Required="0" Valid="0">
            <Description Translatable="1">
                Defines which dynamic fields should be hidden for specific priorities
            </Description>
            <Navigation>Filters</Navigation>
            <Value>
                <Hash>
                    <Item Key="1 very low">NameOfDynamicField</Item>
                </Hash>
            </Value>
        </Setting>
    </otrs_config>

The "PriorityID" in the name can be replaced with any dropdown field name in the dialog. In the default installation
it is I<Dest>, in this case it is the priority selection (the field is named I<PriorityID>).

The keys in the hash have to be the value of the dropdown for which one or more dynamic fields should be hidden.
And the value is the name of the dynamic field.
